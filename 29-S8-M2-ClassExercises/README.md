# UAA-ICI-S8-M2-ClassExercises

> Class exercises made in the subject Metaheuristics 2 (in spanish, "Metaheurísticas 2" or as I abbreviate it "M2") which was given in my eighth semester of my career: Engineer in Intelligent Computing (in spanish, "Ingeniería en Computación Inteligente", or abbreviated "ICI") studied at the Aguascalientes Autonomous University (in spanish, "Universidad Autónoma de Aguascalientes", or abbreviated "UAA").

---

The course was given by the Professor Julio César Ponce Gallegos.

The course objective was to get in depth of the main heuristic techniques.

The exercises were made in Python.

The exercises were made in collaboration with [Andrea Melissa Almeida Ortega](https://github.com/Melissa-AO).
