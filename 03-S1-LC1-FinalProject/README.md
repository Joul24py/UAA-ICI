# UAA-ICI-S1-LC1-FinalProject

> Final project made in the subject Computing Languages 1 (in spanish, "Lenguajes de Computación 1" or as I abbreviate it "LC1") which was given in my first semester of my career: Engineer in Intelligent Computing (in spanish, "Ingeniería en Computación Inteligente", or abbreviated "ICI") studied at the Aguascalientes Autonomous University (in spanish, "Universidad Autónoma de Aguascalientes", or abbreviated "UAA").

The course was given by the Professor Rosalinda Avendaño López.

The course objective was to learn the basics of programming, learning topics as input and output, conditionals or loops; all of this with a first approach in pseudocode and flowcharts and later carried out to the C programming language.

The project was made in C/C++

The project was made in collaboration with José Luis Cardona Rivera and Julio César Pérez Jaime.

The project consisted in:

1. Create an array with 10 registrations that contain an integer worker key with 4 positions.
2. Create an array with 10 registrations that contain the worker name in a string variable separated as Name, Last Name (Father) and Last Name (Mother).
3. Create an array with 10 registrations that contain an integer  salary worker.

These arrays should be generated randomly.

Once the previous requirements were done, the programa has to present the user a menu with the following options:
1. Show all users with all fields.
2. Search for a user giving as a parameter the worker name or the worker key.
3. Sort alphabetically by key, name or salary (optional).
4. Add new users.
5. Delete a user giving as a parameter the worker name or the worker key.
6. Update the key, name or salary of a worker.
