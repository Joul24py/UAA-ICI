# UAA-ICI-S3-ECA-ClassExercises

> Class exercises made in the subject Advanced Computational Structures (in spanish, "Estructuras Computacionales Avanzadas" or as I abbreviate it "ECA") which was given in my third semester of my career: Engineer in Intelligent Computing (in spanish, "Ingeniería en Computación Inteligente", or abbreviated "ICI") studied at the Aguascalientes Autonomous University (in spanish, "Universidad Autónoma de Aguascalientes", or abbreviated "UAA").

The course was given by the Professor Julio César Ponce Gallegos.

The course objective was to get in depth about the most common structures used in programming and learn how to apply them.

The exercises were made in C++.
