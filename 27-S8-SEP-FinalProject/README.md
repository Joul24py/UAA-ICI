# UAA-ICI-S8-SEP-FinalProject

> Final project made in the subject Probabilistic Expert Systems (in spanish, "Sistemas Expertos Probabilísticos" or as I abbreviate it "SEP") which was given in my eighth semester of my career: Engineer in Intelligent Computing (in spanish, "Ingeniería en Computación Inteligente", or abbreviated "ICI") studied at the Aguascalientes Autonomous University (in spanish, "Universidad Autónoma de Aguascalientes", or abbreviated "UAA").

The course was given by the Professor Eunice Esther Ponce de Leon Senti.

The course objective was to apply the PROLOG knowledge and develop a expert system project.
