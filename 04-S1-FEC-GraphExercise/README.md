# UAA-ICI-S1-FEC-GraphExercise

> Class exercise made in the subject Fundamentals of Computational Structures (in spanish, "Fundamentos de Estructuras Computacionales" or as I abbreviate it "FEC") which was given in my first semester of my career: Engineer in Intelligent Computing (in spanish, "Ingeniería en Computación Inteligente", or abbreviated "ICI") studied at the Aguascalientes Autonomous University (in spanish, "Universidad Autónoma de Aguascalientes", or abbreviated "UAA").

---

The course was given by the Professor Alejandro Padilla Díaz.

The course objective was to learn the fundamentals of the structures used to program with topics as Combinatorics, Graph Theory and Propositional Logic.

The exercise was developed when we learned about Graph Theory so we implemented a program in C to strengthen the knowledge in this area.

The exercise was made in C/C++.
