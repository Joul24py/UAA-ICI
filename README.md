# UAA-ICI-S1-LC1-ClassExercises

> Class exercises made in the subject Computing Languages 1 (in spanish, "Lenguajes de Computación 1" or as I abbreviate it "LC1") which was given in my first semester of my career: Engineer in Intelligent Computing (in spanish, "Ingeniería en Computación Inteligente", or abbreviated "ICI") studied at the Aguascalientes Autonomous University (in spanish, "Universidad Autónoma de Aguascalientes", or abbreviated "UAA").

The course was given by the Professor Rosalinda Avendaño López.

The course objective was to learn the basics of programming, learning topics as input and output, conditionals or loops; all of this with a first approach in pseudocode and flowcharts and later carried out to the C programming language.

The exercises were made in C/C++.
