# UAA ICI Coding Exercises

I studied my degree in Engineer in Intelligent Computing (in spanish, "Ingeniería en Computación Inteligente", or abbreviated "ICI") at the Aguascalientes Autonomous University (in spanish, "Universidad Autónoma de Aguascalientes", or abbreviated "UAA") with the class of 2023 and during the five year program, I did code as exercise in the different assignments of the career.

In this repository I combined all of the code done while I studied sorted by subject in the top folders, but also there's presented the subjects in the following table of contents.

Also, there is a programming project that I did where I compile my background as a student in high school and university, which I titled "[My Way](https://my-way.joulessa.tech/)". It includes links to this page as well as notes that I also took during this stage of my life.

The following table shows all of the subjects by semester that I took during my career. The ones with the link are the ones in which I did code during the subject and that code is in this repository. The ones without link are the ones in which I did not code during the subject.
