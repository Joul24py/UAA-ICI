# UAA-ICI-S9-PA-ClassExercises

> Class exercises made in the subject Algorithm Parallelization (in spanish, "Paralelización de Algoritmos" or as I abbreviate it "MD") which was given in my ninth semester of my career: Engineer in Intelligent Computing (in spanish, "Ingeniería en Computación Inteligente", or abbreviated "ICI") studied at the Aguascalientes Autonomous University (in spanish, "Universidad Autónoma de Aguascalientes", or abbreviated "UAA").

The course was given by the Professor Julio César Ponce Gallegos.

The course objective was to get into the techniques to develop algorithms in parallel learning tools as CUDA.

The exercises were made in C++ and CUDA C++.

Some exercises were solved in company:
- The Vehicle Routing problem using ACO in sequential was made in collaboration with [Dariana Gómez Garza](https://github.com/DariGmz) and Fernando Francisco González Arenas.
- The Vehicle Routing problem using ACO in parallel was made in collaboration with Michelle Stephanie Adame, [Dariana Gómez Garza](https://github.com/DariGmz) and Fernando Francisco González Arenas.
