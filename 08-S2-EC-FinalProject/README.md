# UAA-ICI-S2-EC-FinalProject

> Final project made in the subject Computational Structures (in spanish, "Estructuras Computacionales" or as I abbreviate it "EC") which was given in my second semester of my career: Engineer in Intelligent Computing (in spanish, "Ingeniería en Computación Inteligente", or abbreviated "ICI") studied at the Aguascalientes Autonomous University (in spanish, "Universidad Autónoma de Aguascalientes", or abbreviated "UAA").

The course was given by the Professor Francisco Javier Luna Rosas.

The course objective was to know about the most common structures used in programming and learn how to apply them.

The project was made in C++.

The project was made in collaboration with [Dariana Gómez Garza](https://github.com/DariGmz) and Valeria Macías Soto.

The project consisted in an investigation of the sorting algorithms as well as a practice with them, trying to find in this way which was the most efficient one.
