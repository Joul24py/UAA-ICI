> Class exercises made in the subject Intelligent Optimization (in spanish, "Optimización Inteligente" or as I abbreviate it "OI") which was given in my fifth semester of my career: Engineer in Intelligent Computing (in spanish, "Ingeniería en Computación Inteligente", or abbreviated "ICI") studied at the Aguascalientes Autonomous University (in spanish, "Universidad Autónoma de Aguascalientes", or abbreviated "UAA").

The course was given by the Professor Aurora Torres Soto.

The course objective was to have a first touch with metaheuristics learning also some vectorial calculus in the beginning in order to apply algorithms like the Simple Genetic Algorithm, Simulated Annealing and Ant Colony Optimization.

The exercises were made in C++.
