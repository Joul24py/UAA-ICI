# UAA-ICI-S1-FEC-FinalProject

> Final project made in the subject Fundamentals of Computing Structures (in spanish, "Fundamentos de Estructuras Computacionales" or as I abbreviate it "FEC") which was given in my first semester of my career: Engineer in Intelligent Computing (in spanish, "Ingeniería en Computación Inteligente", or abbreviated "ICI") studied at the Aguascalientes Autonomous University (in spanish, "Universidad Autónoma de Aguascalientes", or abbreviated "UAA").

The course was given by the Professor Alejandro Padilla Díaz.

The course objective was to learn the fundamentals of the structures used to program with topics as Combinatorics, Graph Theory and Propositional Logic.

The project was made in C/C++.

The project was made in collaboration with José Luis Cardona Rivera, Jonathan David Pardo Tinoco, Julio César Pérez Jaime and Carlos Martín Zúñiga Elizondo.

## Dedicado a Carlos Martín Zúñiga Elizondo.

The project consisted in:

1. Write a program to change between numerical systems (mainly, between decimal, binary, octal, hexadecimal and maya numerical system).
2. Write a program to paint in screen a graph and connect the cities.
3. Append the program of the class exercises (which can be found in this repo inside the folder [04-S1-FEC-GraphExercise](../04-S1-FEC-GraphExercise/)).
4. Write a parser that can read a propositional logic proposition and so it returns the truth table of the proposition.
