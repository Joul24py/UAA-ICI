# Setting up Emotiv Epoc+ with computer

As this project is based in the Emotiv headsets, it's necessary to download the appropiate software from the [Emotiv downloads](https://www.emotiv.com/emotiv-launcher/) official page, downloading the Emotiv Launcher as a first step.

It's also neccesary to [register for an Emotiv ID](https://www.emotiv.com/my-account/).

In a personal experience, I decided to install the entire offered software in the installation:

- Emotiv Launcher
- EmotivBCI
- Emotiv BrainViz
- EmotivPRO

After this, it runs the Emotiv Launcher with the neuroheadset correctly paired and connected via USB. It should appear as a possible connection when it's running the Emotiv Launcher.

Then it has to be correctly placed in order to detect efficiently the neural activity. Once it's done this, the Emotiv Setup is over, so now it's time to use the [CymatiCorp repository: Cykit](https://github.com/CymatiCorp/CyKit).

# Downloading Cykit

The Cykit download can be found in the [Cykit installation guide](https://github.com/CymatiCorp/CyKit/wiki/How-to-Install-CyKIT).

## Setting up Cykit and first data recovery

As well as a basic setup can be found in the [Cykit stream data guide using OpenViBE](https://github.com/CymatiCorp/CyKit/wiki/How-to-Stream-Data-to-OpenViBE). The following instructions will take from the last step of the previous guide.
