# UAA-ICI-S7-M1-ClassExercises

> Class exercises made in the subject Metaheuristics 1 (in spanish, "Metaheurísticas 1" or as I abbreviate it "M1") which was given in my seventh semester of my career: Engineer in Intelligent Computing (in spanish, "Ingeniería en Computación Inteligente", or abbreviated "ICI") studied at the Aguascalientes Autonomous University (in spanish, "Universidad Autónoma de Aguascalientes", or abbreviated "UAA").

---

The course was given by the Professor Francisco Javier Luna Rosas.

The course objective was to integrate what we learnt in the Optimization subjects with the supervised and unsupervised learning and build a project with this knowledge.

The exercises were made in Python and Java.

Most of the exercises were made in collaboration with [Andrea Melissa Almeida Ortega](https://github.com/Melissa-AO), Óscar Alonso Flores Fernández, [Dariana Gómez Garza](https://github.com/DariGmz), Fernando Francisco González Arenas and [Hiram Efraín Orocio García](https://github.com/hiram57ef).
